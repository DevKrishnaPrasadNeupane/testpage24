<p><b><i><u>Kyoto (京都, Kyōto) is Japan’s oldest city and served as the nation’s</i></u></b>capital and <i>the emperor’s residence for over 1,000 years,</i> from 794 until 1868.Over the centuries, <u>the city has been destroyed by many wars and fires, however, because of its cultural and historical value Kyoto was largely spared by the WWII bombings. </u>It is for this reason that you can still visit many old cultural landmarks and historical sites. And because of the preserved townscape, you will find many people walking around in a beautiful kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) in Kyoto! If you want to try on a kimono and explore the city, you can easily find some kimono rental shops in Kyoto to complete the look to match the historical sites</p>
